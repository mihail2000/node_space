BUGs:

- Creating multiple (=2) new games in a row will crash the server

TODO:

- Move some of the core modules around. I.e. core.js should not be in application/controller
- Implement core-level function(s) to check the proper parameters have been passed to API / controller
- Plan API needed
- Rename the matufw_base_model
- Separate game engine (APIs and models) completely from mid-tier (controllers). ...maybe...
- Create server side game loop
- Figure out how to synchronize server side game loop and client side game loop
- Add proper comments to all API and model classes

DONE:
- Move API handling to core controller (or create API core controller, which would be even better)
- Implement ACL control for API
